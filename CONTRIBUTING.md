# Reporting Bugs

<!--

NOTE:

 - Please keep this section similar to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/366001364/
 - Ensure that the issue templates are up to date with the contents of this page.
 - Ensure that the generated error pages have similar content to the issue templates.

-->

Please make sure to include the following in your bug reports:

 - description of the bug
 - steps to recreate the bug
 - project ID (included by default if you use the bug report links)
 - suspected cause, if you have an idea
 - anything else you want to include
 - do **not** edit the "Debug information" section, if it is present

Feel free to bump your bug by commenting on it if it seems to be going nowhere for a long time.

**If you made the project:** If possible, please try to identify which blocks are misbehaving, and create a small demo project that only contains the blocks necessary to demonstrate the bug, or at least point out which blocks in the original project are misbehaving. This isn't required but it helps a lot.

# Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome.

Please make sure to include the following:

 - **what**: what *exactly* do you want?
 - **why**: what problem does this solve?

# Pull Requests

Contributions are welcome. Builds steps are described in the README.

As long as your PR objectively improves forkphorus by doing something such as fixing a bug, it will probably be accepted.

Please try to keep the code style similar to what's already present, but this won't prevent a pull request from being merged.

## Creating test projects

Consider creating test projects to ensure that bugs don't regress. See https://github.com/forkphorus/forkphorus/tree/master/tests for details.
